### Hi, there! My name is Prince 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Developer and static types junkie. I use static types across all facets of web applications and love exploring zero-knowledge blockchain technology

- 🏗️ Technologies I breathe: Go, Entgo, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Remix & TailwindCSS (used to be a die-hard CSS-in-*s/PandaCSS fan)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I believe if types are used on the frontend and backend, types NEED to be used on the API layer i.e Graphql
