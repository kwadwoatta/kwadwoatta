### Hi, there! My name is Prince 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Developer and static types junkie. I use static types across all facets of web applications and love exploring zero-knowledge blockchain technology

- 🏗️ Technologies I breathe: Go, Entgo, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Remix, PandaCSS (yeah .. I guess we can use Tailwind too 😔)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have an unabashed love for Graphql & CSS-in-JS (shh, it's our little secret 🙊)
